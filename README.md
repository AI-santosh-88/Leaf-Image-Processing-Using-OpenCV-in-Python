üìå Title:
Leaf Image Processing Using OpenCV in Python


üìù Description:
This project demonstrates fundamental image processing techniques using OpenCV in Python. A sample image of a leaf is loaded and processed through various operations such as color conversion, resizing, cropping, and flipping. The main aim is to familiarize with OpenCV functions and explore basic transformations and visualizations used in image analysis.



üõ†Ô∏è Responsibilities / Steps Performed:
1.Package Installation & Importing:
* Installed opencv-python
* Imported necessary libraries (cv2, cv2_imshow)

2.Image Reading & Display:
* Loaded an image from the local file system (leaf.jpg)
* Displayed the original image

3.Color Space Conversions:
* Converted the image to grayscale
* Converted the image to RGB
* Converted the image to HSV

4.Image Resizing:
* Resized the image to dimensions (200, 200)

5.Image Cropping:
* Cropped a section of the image from pixels [100:300, 100:300]

6.Image Flipping:
* Flipped the image vertically
* Flipped the image horizontally
* Flipped the image both horizontally and vertically


üì¶ Packages Used:

üìä Project Summary:

This project serves as a hands-on introduction to image manipulation using the OpenCV library in Python. It provides foundational knowledge necessary for more advanced tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and computer vision applications. The code showcases how to perform basic image processing techniques and view transformations using cv2_imshow, making it an ideal starter project for those learning computer vision.
